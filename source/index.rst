FLIMfit
*************************
FLIMfit is a software package for the analysis and visualisation of time-resolved data from FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging) measurements. It uses highly efficient algorithms that can globally fit FLIM data with modest photon numbers to complex decay models, across hundreds or thousands of fields of view, requiring only tens of seconds of processing time on a reasonable desktop computer. This makes it useful to analyse time series or multiwell plate FLIM data. The algorithms used in *FLIMfit* are discussed in detail in `Warren et al, 2013 <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070687>`_.
